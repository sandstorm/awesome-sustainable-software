# Awesome Sustainable Software Development

# About

In this list, we want to collect links, resources, and tips towards sustainable software developent.

We especially want to highlight practical real-world tips which are directly applicable in practice.

## Supported with ‚ù§Ô∏è by [sandstorm](https://sandstorm.de)

We are currently on our journey towards estabilishing sustainability goals and principles in our day-to-day work - and we want to
collaborate with others and form a community around this.

## Practices

### Docker and Containerization

**Reducing Docker Image Size**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Storage/purple)

Often, docker images are quite big in terms of image size - more than 1 GB is pretty common in "classical applications".

- Use the tool [dive](https://github.com/wagoodman/dive) to analyze docker image size.
- Try to reduce the number of image layers and installed packages.

**Avoid running apps as root**

**Consider Best practices**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Quality/green)

- Follow [Best practices for writing Dockerfiles](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/dockerfile_best-practices/)
- Follow [Awesome Docker](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker#readme)
### Web Server Configuration

**Activate GZIP Compression**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

Gzip compression needs to be explicitly activated in the server config (nginx/apache). With this, you can easily reach big improvements for transferred data, especially for text-like content.

**Configure HTTP Caching**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

By leveraging and properly configuring HTTP caching, you can also reduce data sizes quite a lot.

Common practices include:

- static assets (like JS/CSS) should be cached for a very long time, and include a cache-bust mechanism
- f.e. in Neos CMS, Images are stored content-addressed (i.e. the URL changes if the image contents change) - in this case, these assets can be also cached for a very long time.
- HTML pages should NOT have caching enabled, as this makes changing cached pages impossible during the cache lifetime.

**Minify JS/CSS**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

JS/CSS/SCSS should be minified during the build. During this process, comments, white spaces etc are removed - and multiple scripts are concatenated to one big file (which is positive for compression ratios etc).

### Image/Picture Rendering

**Use WebP format**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

Images are often responsible for most of the traffic. By using the [WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp) format, you can compress graphics lossy or lossless, such that they are 30% smaller than PNGs or JPGs.

By using the `<picture>` tag, you can support fallbacks for older browsers.

**Lazyly load offscreen images**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

By loading offscreen images only when they enter the viewport for the first time, you can drastically reduce the weight of your webpage and save a lot of transferred megabytes. See for example the new `loading` attribute on image and iframe tags.
For support of older browsers see javascript solutions (e.g. https://github.com/aFarkas/lazysizes).

**Reduce colors in images**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

For quite some PNG or GIF images, you can drastically reduce the number of colors until you notice a visual difference. Sometimes, 6 or 4 colors are enough, sometimes 32 or 16. With this trick, you can reduce up to 90% of the file size.

### Application Configuration

**Caching for reducing CPU load**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/CPU/green)

**Prefer event pushing over event polling**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

"And now?", "And now?", "And now?", "And now?", "And now?"

**minimize number of requests**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

**minimize number of transmitted bytes**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

- minize intermediate results
- ‚Ä¶ apply filter on server (instead of client)
- ‚Ä¶ or on database
- design APIs based on the user perspective

**cache large results**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/NetworkTransmission/purple)

**render only what has changed**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

### Tracking

**use existing metrics**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

Eg use web server logs to count number of visits per page.

**track a sample set only**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

Do you need to track every visitor or one out of 100?

### Development and Staging

**plan for local development**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Developer%20Happiness/green)

Make your project start with one or two commands.
Consider using our [Dev Script Runner](https://github.com/sandstorm/dev-script-runner)

**plan for staging environments**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Developer%20Happiness/green)

**limit execution of CI/CD pipelines**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

- do I need to redeploy on readme changes
- and run E2E tests after typo fixes

**testing**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Developer%20Happiness/green)
![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

Make writing tests part of your projects.
Use efficient test scopes (E2E tests versus unit test).

**consider alternatives for tools and libraries when starting a project**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Developer%20Happiness/green)
![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

- sprint boot or micronaut
- react or preact or vue or next
- maven or gradle
- npm or yarn
- webpack or esbuild
- node or deno
- react-native or flutter
- electron or taurin

**don't use AI for trivial tasks**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

Prefer adequat algorithms.

**readable code**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Developer%20Happiness/green)

Follow best practices to structure your code, eg

- [Book Review: A Philosophy of Software Design](https://sandstorm.de/de/blog/post/book-review-a-philosophy-of-software-design.html)
- [How to become a better Software Developer](https://sandstorm.de/de/blog/post/how-to-become-a-better-software-developer.html)

**enable others to maintain you project**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Developer%20Happiness/green)

- aim for open source projects
- do not re-implement things
- pick a license which allow others to improve/continue the project
- use contracts which allow your customers to migrate to another agency

**measure and improve quality**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Developer%20Happiness/green)

> What you can't measure, you can't manage. _(Peter Drucker)_

- use google lighthouse
- ‚Ä¶ or ca11y
- linting
- sonarlint
- TODO: what else

### Avoid waste

**abandon dead project**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Sufficiency/blue)

only develop what will be used

**shutdown idle servers**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Sufficiency/blue)

**shutdown unused services (scale to zero/terminate)**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Sufficiency/blue)

scale to zero or terminate

**think of your data retention policy**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Sufficiency/blue)

delete no longer needed data, ie

- logs and statistics
- old application version
- CI/CD results and artifacts

### Hosting

**co-locate small services**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

eg by using VMs, Kubernetes or serverless computing

**choose green hosters**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

We use [Hetzner](https://www.hetzner.com/unternehmen/umweltschutz/?country=de).

**deploy a secure SSH configuration**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Security/orange)

ie no root and password logins

**plan for regular updates**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Security/orange)

**throttle metric collection**

![](https://badgen.net/badge/Type/Efficiency/green)

You do not need to check the remaining disk space every minute üòâ.
